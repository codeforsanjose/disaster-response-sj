# disaster-response-sj

Inspired by civic tech volunteer responses to hurricanes Harvey and Irma,
the goal of the disaster-response-sj project is to engage with San Jose's
Office of Emergency Services to discuss how CfSJ can contribute to
disaster response planning and execution.

## Plan

1. Gather information on existing system
2. Determine pain points or missing pieces of existing system
3. Look for existing tools to address #2

## Resources

### San Jose

via @mthong:

  [City Council video and documentation](http://sanjose.granicus.com/MediaPlayer.php?view_id=51&clip_id=9856)

  Agenda items 3.5, 3.6 and 3.7 all relate to the flood response and future emergency management. I’d specifically recommend watching/listening to the City staff presentation and public comment (go to item 3.5 in the video index), or reading the staff memo for item 3.6.


See particularly Sec. 3.6 Memorandum; it's 130 pages total (!!) but the TL;DR is Appendix B and C.
